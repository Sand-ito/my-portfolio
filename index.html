                Hi! My name is Josh Livak. I have only been coding for seven days, but I have 
                a really good teacher. Here are all of my works so far I hope you enjoy them! I plan to replace them
                with something more impressive each week. My favorite project I have worked on so far is this portfolio.
                I am really happy with how it turned out.
            </p>
            <p class="me-text">
                Before coding I was a jack of all traits. I worked as an EMT, raft guide, prep cook, a day care, and plenty more.
                Most of these jobs were to mainly allow me to be a ski and whitewater bum. But I have had my fill of fun and now
                I want to persue a career. I was at the right place and right time to hear about a coding boot camp. I am really 
                enjoying the progression of the class at the moment. I also am happy to be in a career path that requires even
                more learning after. 
            </p>
            <p class="me-text">
                Thank you for taking your time to read and interact with my portfolio. It means a lot to me. Have a nice day.
            </p>
